      <h1> Goal </h1>

      <p>
        Because of Covid-19, there's been a huge emphasis on in-person
        limitations in bigger settings, such as no more than 50 people in a
        lecture hall. In order to ensure this rule is being followed, it can be
        regulated through counting how many people are in a room. However,
        counting manually can be tedious and even hard. Keeping this in mind,
        our idea plans on making it easier by using a camera to object detect
        the total number of people in the room. We would assume that the camera
        in the room views/covers the entire room and the camera will detect
        solely humans (meaning objects similar looking do not get detected as
        human). This idea would overall make it easier to enforce covid
        guidelines and ensure rules are not being broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our project is based mostly around object detection, specifically
        detecting people in a room such as a lecture hall. We want to make a web
        based product that we can link to a stream that can count people live.
        It is important that our project can differentiate between humans and
        other things so that it does not count things such as a personâ€™s
        backpack as another person. The final project should be able to count
        how many people are in a room and give a warning when that number is
        above a certain threshold.
